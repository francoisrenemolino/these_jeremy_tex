It is a consensus of the ISMRM Perfusion Study Group and the European ASL in Dementia consortium, both of whom met to reach this consensus in October 2012 in Amsterdam. Although ASL continues to undergo rapid technical development, we believe that current ASL methods are robust and ready to provide useful clinical information, and that a consensus statement on recommended implementations will help the clinical community to adopt a standardized approach. In this review, we describe the major considerations and trade-offs in implementing an ASL protocol and provide specific recommendations for a standard approach. Our conclusion is that as an optimal default implementation, we recommend pseudo-continuous labeling, background suppression, a segmented three-dimensional readout without vascular crushing gradients, and calculation and presentation of both label/control difference images and cerebral blood flow in absolute units using a simplified model.

The robustness and accuracy of our technique are evaluated on a vascular phantom scanned in different orientations. The reconstructed surface is compared to a surface generated by marching cubes followed by decimation and smoothing.

abstract = {Blood flow in the circle of Willis (CoW) is modelled using the 1-D equations of pressure and flow wave propagation in compliant vessels. The model starts at the left ventricle and includes the largest arteries that supply the CoW. Based on published physiological data, it is able to capture the main features of pulse wave propagation along the aorta, at the brachiocephalic bifurcation and throughout the cerebral arteries. The collateral ability of the complete CoW and its most frequent anatomical variations is studied in normal conditions and after occlusion of a carotid or vertebral artery (VA). Our results suggest that the system does not require collateral pathways through the communicating arteries to adequately perfuse the brain of normal subjects. The communicating arteries become important in cases of missing or occluded vessels, the anterior communicating artery (ACoA) being a more critical collateral pathway than the posterior communicating arteries (PCoAs) if an internal carotid artery (ICA) is occluded. Occlusions of the VAs proved to be far less critical than occlusions of the ICAs. The worst scenario in terms of reduction in the mean cerebral outflows is a CoW without the first segment of an anterior cerebral artery combined with an occlusion of the contralateral ICA. Furthermore, in patients without any severe occlusion of a carotid or VA, the direction of flow measured at the communicating arteries corresponds to the side of the CoW with an absent or occluded artery. Finally, we study the effect of partial occlusions of the communicating arteries on the cerebral flows, which again confirms that the ACoA is a more important collateral pathway than the PCoAs if an ICA is occluded. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Blood supply through collateral pathways improves regional cerebral blood flow and may protect against ischemic events. The effect of collaterals on the risk of stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA), in the presence of angiographic severe internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis, was assessed. METHODS: Angiographic collateral filling through anterior communicating and posterior communicating arteries and retrograde filling through ophthalmic arteries were determined in all patients at entry into the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial. Kaplan-Meier event-free survival analyses were performed on 339 medically treated and 342 surgically treated patients. RESULTS: The presence of collaterals supplying the symptomatic ICA increased with severity of stenosis. Two-year risk of hemispheric stroke in medically treated patients with severe ICA stenosis was reduced in the presence of collaterals: 27.8\% to 11.3\% (P=0.005). Similar reductions were observed for hemispheric TIA (36.1\% versus 19.1\%; P=0.008) and disabling or fatal strokes (13.3\% versus 6.3\%; P=0.11). For surgically treated patients, the perioperative risk of hemispheric stroke was 1.1\% in the presence of collaterals versus 4. 9\% when absent. The 2-year stroke risks for surgical patients with and without collaterals were 5.9\% versus 8.4\%, respectively. Neither comparison in the surgical group was statistically significant. The observed reductions were independent of the degree of ICA stenosis and other vascular risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Collaterals are associated with a lower risk of hemispheric stroke and TIA, both long term and perioperatively. Angiographic identification of collaterals assists in identifying patients with severe ICA stenosis at lower risk of stroke and TIA.},

Inadequate data in this area can lead to severe underestimation of the spatial specificity of the BOLD response. We took thick sections of Indian ink injected human brain and, using confocal laser microscopy and a novel three-dimensional computer-assisted method we extracted and analyzed hundreds of thousands of vascular segments within a large area of cortex. From this database the global densities, the statistical distributions of diameters and lengths were analysed, separating the tree-like and the net-like parts of the microcirculation. Furthermore, our analysis included variations in volume density along the cortical depth and along vectors parallel to the cortical surface.

The resulting 3D images with a spatial resolution of less than the minimum capillary diameter permit a complete description of the entire vascular network for volumes as large as tens of cubic millimeters. The structural properties of the vascular networks were investigated by several multiscale methods such as fractal and power-spectrum analysis. These investigations gave a new coherent picture of normal and pathological complex vascular structures. They showed that normal cortical vascular networks have scale-invariant fractal properties on a small scale from 1.4 mum up to 40 to 65 mum. Above this threshold, vascular networks can be considered as homogeneous. Tumor vascular networks show similar characteristics, but the validity range of the fractal regime extend to much larger spatial dimensions. These 3D results shed new light on previous two dimensional analyses giving for the first time a direct measurement of vascular modules associated with vessel-tissue surface exchange.},

The cerebrovenous system represents a complex three-dimensional structure that is often asymmetric and considerably represent more variable pattern than the arterial anatomy. Particular emphasis is devoted to the venous return to extracranial drainage routes. As the state-of-the-art-imaging methods are playing a greater role in visualizing the intracranial venous system at present, its clinically pertinent anatomy and physiology has gain increasing interest, even so only few data are available. For this reason, experimental research on specific biophysical (fluid dynamic, rheologic factors) and hemodynamic (venous pressure, cerebral venous blood flow) parameters of the cerebral venous system is more on the focus; especially as these parameters are different to the cerebral arterial system. Particular emphasis is devoted to the venous return to extracranial drainage routes. From the present point of view, it seems that the cerebrovenous system may be one of the most important factors that guarantee normal brain function. In the light of this increasing interest in the cerebral venous system, the authors have summarized the current knowledge of the physiology of the cerebrovenous system and discuss it is in the light of its clinical relevance.},

abstract = {The anatomical variations of sylvian vein and cistern were investigated during the pterional approach in 750 operative cases with different pathologies. All patients were operated on at the Neurosurgical Department of Ataturk University Medical School, Erzurum, Turkiye. The patients underwent surgery for the lesions necessitating the right or left pterional approach. The findings were recorded during surgical intervention and observed through the operative sketches of the pathologies, the slides, and videotapes of the operations. In our study, we surgically classified the variations of sylvian vein, according to its branching and draining patterns. Type I: The fronto-orbital (frontosylvian), fronto-parietal (parietosylvian) and anterior temporal (temporosylvian) veins drain into one sylvian vein. Type II: Two superficial sylvian veins with separated basal vein draining into the sphenoparietal and Rosenthal's basal vein. Type III: Two superficial sylvian veins draining into the sphenoparietal and the superior petrosal veins. Type IV: Hypoplastic superficial sylvian vein and the deep one. Four types of sylvian vein variations were defined as follows. The type I was seen in 52.8\% (n = 396), the type II was found in 19.2\% (n = 144), type III was recorded in 18.2\% (n = 137), and type IV, or hypoplastic and deep form was discovered in 9.8\% (n = 73) of patients. The coursing of sylvian vein was in the temporal side (Temporal Coursing) in 62.4 percent of the cases (n = 469), in the frontal side (Frontal Coursing) in 25 \% of the patients (n = 187) and in 9 percent of the cases (n = 67) in the deep localization (Deep Coursing). Only 3.6\% of the cases (n = 27) showed Mixed Coursing. The variations of the sylvian cisterns were classified into three types, according to the relationships between the lateral fronto-orbital gyrus and the superior temporal gyrus. In Sylvian type, the frontal and temporal lobes are loosely (Sylvian Type A, wide and large) or tightly (Sylvian Type B, close and narrow) approximated on the surface thereby covering the substance of the sylvian cistern. In Frontal Type, the proximal part of the lateral fronto-orbital gyrus herniated into the temporal lobe. In Temporal Type, the proximal part of the superior temporal gyrus herniated into the lateral fronto-orbital gyrus. The variations of the sylvian cisterns in 750 patients with different pathologies, were as follows: in 47.7\% (n = 358) Sylvian type A, in 27.2\% percent (n = 204) Sylvian type B, in 16.3\% (n = 122) frontal type and in 8.8\% (n = 66) temporal type. We concluded that venous perfusion discorder of the brain is the most important factor during the pterional approach. Careful intraoperative assessment and protection of the sylvian vein, which is a surgical pitfall, is an indispensable part of the operation. The recognition of the anatomical variations of the sylvian vein and cistern, and the detailed knowledge of the microvascular relationships and the importance of preservation of this vein at that level, will allow the neurosurgeon, believing in the minimally invasive neurosurgical techniques, to construct a better and safer microdissection plan, to save time, and can prevent postoperative neurological deficits.},

abstract = {The sparsity which is implicit in MR images is exploited to significantly undersample k-space. Some MR images such as angiograms are already sparse in the pixel representation; other, more complicated images have a sparse representation in some transform domain-for example, in terms of spatial finite-differences or their wavelet coefficients. According to the recently developed mathematical theory of compressed-sensing, images with a sparse representation can be recovered from randomly undersampled k-space data, provided an appropriate nonlinear recovery scheme is used. Intuitively, artifacts due to random undersampling add as noise-like interference. In the sparse transform domain the significant coefficients stand out above the interference. A nonlinear thresholding scheme can recover the sparse coefficients, effectively recovering the image itself. In this article, practical incoherent undersampling schemes are developed and analyzed by means of their aliasing interference. Incoherence is introduced by pseudo-random variable-density undersampling of phase-encodes. The reconstruction is performed by minimizing the l(1) norm of a transformed image, subject to data fidelity constraints. Examples demonstrate improved spatial resolution and accelerated acquisition for multislice fast spin-echo brain imaging and 3D contrast enhanced angiography.},

abstractNote={In MRI, the main magnetic field polarizes the electron cloud of a molecule, generating a 
chemical shift for observer protons within the molecule and a magnetic susceptibility inhomogeneity field 
for observer protons outside the molecule. The number of water protons surrounding a molecule for 
detecting its magnetic susceptibility is vastly greater than the number of protons within the molecule 
for detecting its chemical shift. However, the study of tissue magnetic susceptibility has been hindered 
by poor molecular specificities of hitherto used methods based on MRI signal phase and T2* contrast, 
which depend convolutedly on surrounding susceptibility sources. Deconvolution of the MRI signal phase 
can determine tissue susceptibility but is challenged by the lack of MRI signal in the background and 
by the zeroes in the dipole kernel. Recently, physically meaningful regularizations, including the 
Bayesian approach, have been developed to enable accurate quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) 
for studying iron distribution, metabolic oxygen consumption, blood degradation, calcification, 
demyelination, and other pathophysiological susceptibility changes, as well as contrast agent 
biodistribution in MRI. This paper attempts to summarize the basic physical concepts and essential 
algorithmic steps in QSM, to describe clinical and technical issues under active development, and to

It briefly introduces the physical background of the underlying bulk magnetic susceptibility effects, on which this approach is based, and it demonstrates the successful application of the method for imaging different intracranial lesions, like venous anomalies, arteriovenous malformations and brain tumors. The susceptibility difference between venous blood and the surrounding tissue is used to generate contrast. Using this method it is possible to visualize draining veins in lesions better than conventional magnetic resonance imaging methods, which often require application of a contrast medium or even conventional catheter angiography. Limitations of the method are discussed. The ability to highlight deoxygenated blood with high spatial resolution yields important vascular parameters which may be helpful for improved modeling of MR signal changes during functional brain activation, it may lead to a better understanding of brain function in diseased states, or it may even offer the possibility of differentiating benign from malignant tumors non-invasively.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a method of choice for establishing the correct diagnosis in a great majority of neurologic disorders, especially in detection the causes of seizures and both acute and slowly progressive neurologic disturbances, computerized tomography is becoming more frequently excluded from obligate spectrum of diagnostic protocol. METHODS: MRI was performed on 1.5 T MR scanner in two patients, in one suffering from pseudohypoparathyroidism, and in another with Fahr disease, while CT was initially excluded from the diagnostic protocol. In third patient, 11-year-old boy with hypercalcemia, both CT and MRI were indicated because of seizure attack. RESULTS: Completely normal appearing brain parenchyma was seen on T2W images in a patient with clinical diagnosis of pseudohypoparathyroidism while extensive intracerebral calcifications were noted after additionally performed computerized tomography of the brain. In another patient with Fahr disease and neurologic symptoms, extensive calcifications were evident on CT, while MR examination had revealed bilateral symmetric lesions of prolonged T2W signal in the basal ganglia, supratentorial white matter and cerebellum, most compatible toxic/metabolic demyelination. In the third patient, a boy with hypercalcemia, marked left parietal cortical calcification was noted on CT, while MRI, including T2 gradient-echo sequence was inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS: MRI, without CT, can be not only confusing, but even misleading diagnostic modality for detection of not only subtle, but also extensive cerebral calcifications. The benefit of gradient-echo T2 sequence, that is usually included in MR protocol when intracranial calcifications are suspected, is also rather limited.},

QSM with ℓ1 and ℓ2 regularization are compared in numerical simulations of vessel structures with known magnetic susceptibility.

SvO2 values in major cerebral veins lie within the normal physiological range reported by (15) O positron emission tomography. SvO2 from QSM is consistent with previous MR susceptometry methods for vessel segments oriented parallel to the main magnetic field. In vessel simulations, ℓ1 regularization results in less than 10\% SvO2 absolute error across all vessel tilt orientations and provides more accurate SvO2 estimation than ℓ2 regularization.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The proposed analysis of susceptibility images enables reliable mapping of quantitative SvO2 along venograms and may facilitate clinical use of venous oxygenation imaging.},

abstract = {For the last century, there has been great physiological interest in brain iron and its role in brain function and disease. It is well known that iron accumulates in the brain for people with Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, chronic hemorrhage, cerebral infarction, anemia, thalassemia, hemochromatosis, Hallervorden-Spatz, Down syndrome, AIDS and in the eye for people with macular degeneration. Measuring the amount of nonheme iron in the body may well lead to not only a better understanding of the disease progression but an ability to predict outcome. As there are many forms of iron in the brain, separating them and quantifying each type have been a major challenge. In this review, we present our understanding of attempts to measure brain iron and the potential of doing so with magnetic resonance imaging. Specifically, we examine the response of the magnetic resonance visible iron in tissue that produces signal changes in both magnitude and phase images. These images seem to correlate with brain iron content, perhaps ferritin specifically, but still have not been successfully exploited to accurately and precisely quantify brain iron. For future quantitative studies of iron content we propose four methods: correlating R2' and phase to iron content; applying a special filter to the phase to obtain a susceptibility map; using complex analysis to extract the product of susceptibility and volume content of the susceptibility source; and using early and late echo information to separately predict susceptibility and volume content.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To enable fast reconstruction of quantitative susceptibility maps with total variation penalty and automatic regularization parameter selection.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: ℓ1 -Regularized susceptibility mapping is accelerated by variable splitting, which allows closed-form evaluation of each iteration of the algorithm by soft thresholding and fast Fourier transforms. This fast algorithm also renders automatic regularization parameter estimation practical. A weighting mask derived from the magnitude signal can be incorporated to allow edge-aware regularization.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Compared with the nonlinear conjugate gradient (CG) solver, the proposed method is 20 times faster. A complete pipeline including Laplacian phase unwrapping, background phase removal with SHARP filtering, and ℓ1 -regularized dipole inversion at 0.6 mm isotropic resolution is completed in 1.2 min using MATLAB on a standard workstation compared with 22 min using the CG solver. This fast reconstruction allows estimation of regularization parameters with the L-curve method in 13 min, which would have taken 4 h with the CG algorithm. The proposed method also permits magnitude-weighted regularization, which prevents smoothing across edges identified on the magnitude signal. This more complicated optimization problem is solved 5 times faster than the nonlinear CG approach. Utility of the proposed method is also demonstrated in functional blood oxygen level-dependent susceptibility mapping, where processing of the massive time series dataset would otherwise be prohibitive with the CG solver.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Online reconstruction of regularized susceptibility maps may become feasible with the proposed dipole inversion.

abstract = {Quantitative magnetic susceptibility mapping (QSM) has recently been introduced to provide a novel quantitative and local MRI contrast. However, the anatomical contrast represented by in vivo susceptibility maps has not yet been compared systematically and comprehensively with gradient (recalled) echo (GRE) magnitude, frequency, and R2
* images. Therefore, this study compares high-resolution quantitative susceptibility maps with conventional GRE imaging approaches (magnitude, frequency, R2
*) in healthy individuals at 7T with respect to anatomic tissue contrast. Volumes-of-interest were analyzed in deep and cortical gray matter (GM) as well as in white matter (WM) on R2
* and susceptibility maps. High-resolution magnetic susceptibility maps of the human brain exhibited superb contrast that allowed the identification of substructures of the thalamus, midbrain and basal ganglia, as well as of the cerebral cortex. These were consistent with histology but not generally visible on magnitude, frequency or R2
*-maps. Common target structures for deep brain stimulation, including substantia nigra pars reticulata, ventral intermediate nucleus, subthalamic nucleus, and the substructure of the internal globus pallidus, were clearly distinguishable from surrounding tissue on magnetic susceptibility maps. The laminar substructure of the cortical GM differed depending on the anatomical region, i.e., a cortical layer with increased magnetic susceptibility, corresponding to the Stria of Gennari, was found in the GM of the primary visual cortex, V1, whereas a layer with reduced magnetic susceptibility was observed in the GM of the temporal cortex. Both magnetic susceptibility and R2
* values differed substantially in cortical GM depending on the anatomic regions. Regression analysis between magnetic susceptibility and R2
* values of WM and GM structures suggested that variations in myelin content cause the overall contrast between gray and white matter on susceptibility maps and that both R2
* and susceptibility values provide linear measures for iron content in GM. In conclusion, quantitative magnetic susceptibility mapping provides a non-invasive and spatially specific contrast that opens the door to the assessment of diseases characterized by variation in iron and/or myelin concentrations. Its ability to reflect anatomy of deep GM structures with superb delineation may be useful for neurosurgical applications. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Given the size and complexity of modern angiographic acquisitions, segmentation is a key step toward the accurate visualization, diagnosis and quantification of vascular pathologies. Despite the tremendous amount of past and on-going dedicated research, vascular segmentation remains a challenging task. In this paper, we review state-of-the-art literature on vascular segmentation, with a particular focus on 3D contrast-enhanced imaging modalities (MRA and CTA). We structure our analysis along three axes: models, features and extraction schemes. We first detail model-based assumptions on the vessel appearance and geometry which can embedded in a segmentation approach. We then review the image features that can be extracted to evaluate these models. Finally, we discuss how existing extraction schemes combine model and feature information to perform the segmentation task. Each component (model, feature and extraction scheme) plays a crucial role toward the efficient, robust and accurate segmentation of vessels of interest. Along each axis of study, we discuss the theoretical and practical properties of recent approaches and highlight the most advanced and promising ones. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The segmentation of the human airway tree from volumetric computed tomography (CT) images builds an important step for many clinical applications and for physiological studies. Previously proposed algorithms suffer from one or several problems: leaking into the surrounding lung parenchyma, the need for the user to manually adjust parameters, excessive runtime. Low-dose CT scans are increasingly utilized in lung screening studies, but segmenting them with traditional airway segmentation algorithms often yields less than satisfying results. In this paper, a new airway segmentation method based on fuzzy connectivity is presented. Small adaptive regions of interest are used that follow the airway branches as they are segmented. This has several advantages. It makes it possible to detect leaks early and avoid them, the segmentation algorithm can automatically adapt to changing image parameters, and the computing time is kept within moderate values. The new method is robust in the sense that it works on various types of scans (low-dose and regular dose, normal subjects and diseased subjects) without the need for the user to manually adjust any parameters. Comparison with a commonly used region-grow segmentation algorithm shows that the newly proposed method retrieves a significantly higher count of airway branches. A method that conducts accurate cross-sectional airway measurements on airways is presented as an additional processing step. Measurements are conducted in the original gray-level volume. Validation on a phantom shows that subvoxel accuracy is achieved for all airway sizes and airway orientations.},

independent of the local width. The filter is steerable in both the

Monte Carlo experiments using simulated and clinical data are used to quantify how these "dynamic-scale" enhancements address clinical needs regarding speed, accuracy, and automation. In particular, we show that dynamic-scale ridge traversal is insensitive to its initial parameter settings, operates with little additional computational overhead, tracks centerlines with subvoxel accuracy, passes branch points, and handles significant image noise.

The system of differential equations of first principles conservation balances is discretized and solved numerically. Fluid-solid interactions of the brain parenchyma with cerebral blood and CSF are calculated. The model provides the transitions from normal dynamics to the diseased state during the onset of communicating hydrocephalus.

abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate vessel density changes with increasing age in three areas of the brain and to correlate these changes with leukoaraiosis (LA) on the basis of magnetic resonance (MR) images and location in deep white matter (WM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Internal review board approval or informed consent from next of kin was not required. Brains of 21 subjects (mean age, 72.5 years; 12 men, nine women) were evaluated at autopsy with MR imaging. The presence of LA was indicated by confluent or patchy areas of hyperintensity in deep WM. Microvascular density (percentage of vessel area divided by total area) in subjects with LA was measured with computerized morphometric analysis in LA lesions, healthy-appearing WM at MR imaging, and the cortex. These measurements were compared with each other and with measurements from corresponding areas in healthy subjects. Afferent vasculature was stained with alkaline phosphatase in celloidin sections. Hypotheses were tested with computation of a series of repeated-measures linear mixed models. RESULTS: Autopsy brains from 12 subjects with LA (mean age, 72 years; six men, six women) and nine subjects without LA (mean age, 73 years; six men, three women) were studied. Afferent microvascular density +/- standard deviation in LA lesions in deep WM (2.56\% +/- 1.56) was significantly lower than that in corresponding deep WM of healthy subjects (3.20\% +/- 1.82) (P = .018). Subjects with LA demonstrated decreased afferent vascular density at early ages in all three areas of the brain when compared with healthy subjects of the same age. CONCLUSION: Findings of decreased afferent vascular density in the area of LA and outside the lesion indicate that LA is a generalized cerebrovascular disease process rather than one confined to deep WM.},

abstract = {Although a wide range of approaches have been developed to automatically assess the volume of brain regions from MRI, the reproducibility of these algorithms across different scanners and pulse sequences, their accuracy in different clinical populations and sensitivity to real changes in brain volume have not always been comprehensively examined. Firstly we present a comprehensive testing protocol which comprises 312 freely available MR images to assess the accuracy, reproducibility and sensitivity of automated brain segmentation techniques. Accuracy is assessed in infants, young adults and patients with Alzheimer's disease in comparison to gold standard measures by expert observers using a manual technique based on Cavalieri's principle. The protocol determines the reliability of segmentation between scanning sessions, different MRI pulse sequences and 1.5. T and 3. T field strengths and examines their sensitivity to small changes in volume using a large longitudinal dataset. Secondly we apply this testing protocol to a novel algorithm for segmenting the lateral ventricles and compare its performance to the widely used FSL FIRST and FreeSurfer methods. The testing protocol produced quantitative measures of accuracy, reliability and sensitivity of lateral ventricle volume estimates for each segmentation method. The novel algorithm showed high accuracy in all populations (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC > 0.95), good reproducibility between MRI pulse sequences (ICC > 0.99) and was sensitive to age related changes in longitudinal data. FreeSurfer demonstrated high accuracy (ICC > 0.95), good reproducibility (ICC > 0.99) and sensitivity whilst FSL FIRST showed good accuracy in young adults and infants (ICC > 0.90) and good reproducibility (ICC = 0.98), but was unable to segment ventricular volume in patients with Alzheimer's disease or healthy subjects with large ventricles. Using the same computer system, the novel algorithm and FSL FIRST processed a single MRI image in less than 10. min while FreeSurfer took approximately 7. h. The testing protocol presented enables the accuracy, reproducibility and sensitivity of different algorithms to be compared. We also demonstrate that the novel segmentation algorithm and FreeSurfer are both effective in determining lateral ventricular volume and are well suited for multicentre and longitudinal MRI studies. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Automatic segmentation of the human brain ventricular system from MR images is useful in studies of brain anatomy and its diseases. Existing intensity-based segmentation methods are adaptive to large shape and size variations of the ventricular system, but may leak to the non-ventricular regions due to the non-homogeneity, noise and partial volume effect in the images. Deformable model-based methods are more robust to noise and alleviate the leakage problem, but may generate wrong results when the shape or size of the ventricle to be segmented in the images has a large difference in comparison to its model. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-based region growing and trimming approach where: (1) a model of a ventricular system is used to define regions of interest (ROI) for the four ventricles (i.e., left, right, third and fourth); (2) to segment a ventricle in its ROI, a region growing procedure is first applied to obtain a connected region that contains the ventricle, and (3) a region trimming procedure is then employed to trim the non-ventricle regions. A hysteretic thresholding is developed for the region growing procedure to cope with the partial volume effect and minimize non-ventricular regions. The domain knowledge on the shape and intensity features of the ventricular system is used for the region trimming procedure. Due to the joint use of the model-based and intensity-based approaches, our method is robust to noise and large shape and size variations. Experiments on 18 simulated and 58 clinical MR images show that the proposed approach is able to segment the ventricular system accurately with the dice similarity coefficient ranging from 91\% to 99\%.},

The algorithm is based upon region-growing and mathematical morphology operators and starts from a coarse binary total brain segmentation, which is obtained from the 3-D-FFE image. Anatomical knowledge of the ventricular system has been incorporated into the method in order to find all constituting parts of the system, even if they are disconnected, and to avoid inclusion of nonventricle cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) regions. A test of the method on a synthetic MR brain image produced a segmentation overlap of 0.98 between the simulated ventricles ("model") and those defined by the algorithm. Further tests were performed on a large data set of 227 1.5 T MR brain images. The algorithm yielded useful results for 98\% of the images. The automatic segmentations had intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.996 for the lateral ventricles and 0.86 for the third ventricle, with manually edited segmentations. Comparison of ventricular volumes of schizophrenia patients compared with those of healthy control subjects showed results in agreement with the literature.},

abstract = {Measures of brain activation (e.g., changes in scalp electrical potentials) have become the most popular method for inferring brain function. However, examining brain disruption (e.g., examining behavior after brain injury) can complement activation studies. Activation techniques identify regions involved with a task, whereas disruption techniques are able to discover which regions are crucial for a task. Voxel-based lesion mapping can be used to determine relationships between behavioral measures and the location of brain injury, revealing the function of brain regions. Lesion mapping can also correlate the effectiveness of neurosurgery with the location of brain resection, identifying optimal surgical targets. Traditionally, voxel-based lesion mapping has employed the chi-square test when the clinical measure is binomial and the Student's t test when measures are continuous. Here we suggest that the Liebermeister approach for binomial data is more sensitive than the chi-square test. We also suggest that a test described by Brunner and Munzel is more appropriate than the t test for nonbinomial data because clinical and neuropsychological data often violate the assumptions of the t test. We test our hypotheses comparing statistical tests using both simulated data and data obtained from a sample of stroke patients with disturbed spatial perception. We also developed software to implement these tests (MRIcron), made freely available to the scientific community.},

Our objective was to investigate the association of hypertension with global and regional cerebral vasoreactivity to CO(2) using continuous arterial spin labeling MRI, independent of stroke and white matter hyperintensities. Participants (n=62; mean age: 66.7±1.0 years, 55\% women, 84\% white, 65\% hypertension, 47\% stroke) underwent arterial spin labeling perfusion MRI during normal breathing, 5\% CO(2) rebreathing, and hyperventilation, as well as 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Vasoreactivity was the slope of the regression between cerebral perfusion and end-tidal CO(2). White matter hyperintensity volumes were quantified. Nighttime dipping was calculated as the percentage decline in nighttime/daytime blood pressure. After accounting for stroke and white matter hyperintensity volume, hypertensive participants had lower global vasoreactivity (1.11±0.13 versus 0.43±0.1 mL/100 g per minute per millimeter of mercury; P=0.0012). Regionally, this was significant in the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes. Higher mean systolic blood pressure was associated with lower vasoreactivity (decreased by 0.11 U/10-mm Hg increase in systolic blood pressure; P=0.04), but nighttime dipping was not (P=0.2). The magnitude of decrease in vasoreactivity in hypertension without stroke was comparable to the magnitude of decrease in vasoreactivity in stroke without hypertension. Hypertension has a direct negative effect on the cerebrovascular circulation independent of white matter hyperintensities and stroke that is comparable to that seen with stroke. Because lower vasoreactivity is associated with poor outcomes, studies of the impact of antihypertensive on vasoreactivity are important.},

abstract = {This presentation describes structural and functional properties of the cerebral circulation that are unique to the brain, an organ with high metabolic demands, and the need for tight water and ion homeostasis. Autoregulation is pronounced in the brain, with myogenic, metabolic, and neurogenic mechanisms contributing to maintain relatively constant blood flow during both increases and de- creases in pressure. In addition, unlike peripheral organs where the majority of vascular resistance resides in small arteries and arterioles, large extracranial and intracranial arteries contribute signifi- cantly to vascular resistance in the brain. The prominent role of large arteries in cerebrovascular resistance helps maintain blood flow and protect downstream vessels during changes in perfusion pressure. The cerebral endothelium is also unique in that its barrier properties are in some way more like epithelium than endothelium in the periphery. The cerebral endothelium, known as the blood–brain barrier, has specialized tight junctions that do not allow ions to pass freely and has very low hydraulic conductivity and transcellular transport. This special configuration modifies Starling’s forces in the brain such that ions retained in the vascular lumen oppose water movement due to hy- drostatic pressure. Tight water regulation is necessary in the brain because it has limited capacity for expansion within the skull. Increased intracranial pressure due to vasogenic edema can cause severe neurologic complications and death. This chapter will review these special features of the cerebral circulation and how they contribute to the physiology of the brain.},

@article{Lang2003,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that a moving correlation index between mean arterial blood pressure and intracranial pressure, called PRx, can be used to monitor and quantify cerebral vasomotor reactivity in patients with head injury. OBJECTIVES: To validate this index and study its relation with cerebral blood flow velocity and cerebral autoregulation; and to identify variables associated with impairment or preservation of cerebral vasomotor reactivity. METHODS: The PRx was validated in a prospective study of 40 head injured patients. A PRx value of less than 0.3 indicates intact cerebral vasomotor reactivity, and a value of more than 0.3, impaired reactivity. Arterial blood pressure, intracranial pressure, mean cerebral perfusion pressure, and cerebral blood flow velocity, measured bilaterally with transcranial Doppler ultrasound, were recorded. Dynamic cerebrovascular autoregulation was measured using a moving correlation coefficient between arterial blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity, the Mx, for each cerebral hemisphere. All variables were compared in patients with intact and impaired cerebral vasomotor reactivity. RESULTS: No correlation between arterial blood pressure or cerebral perfusion pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity was seen in 19 patients with intact cerebral vasomotor reactivity. In contrast, the correlation between these variables was significant in 21 patients with impaired cerebral vasomotor reactivity, whose cerebral autoregulation was reduced. There was no correlation with intracranial pressure, arterial blood pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, or interhemispheric cerebral autoregulation differences, but the values for these indices were largely within normal limits. CONCLUSIONS: The PRx is valid for monitoring and quantifying cerebral vasomotor reactivity in patients with head injury. This intracranial pressure based index reflects changes in cerebral blood flow and cerebral autoregulatory capacity, suggesting a close link between blood flow and intracranial pressure in head injured patients. This explains why increases in arterial blood pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure may be useful for reducing intracranial pressure in selected head injured patients (those with intact cerebral vasomotor reactivity).},

abstract = {Local cerebral blood flow is lowered in many brain areas of the rat by high-dose pentobarbital (50 mg/kg). In the present study, the mechanism of this flow change was examined by measuring the distribution of radiolabeled red blood cells (RBCs) and albumin (RISA) in small parenchymal microvessels and calculating the microvascular distribution spaces and mean transit times of RBCs, RISA, and blood. In most brain areas, pentobarbital slightly decreased the RISA space, modestly increased the RBC space, and did not alter the blood space. The mean transit times of RBCs, RISA, and blood through the perfused microvessels were considerably greater in treated rats than in controls. These findings indicate that the mechanism by which high-dose pentobarbital diminishes local cerebral blood flow in rat brain is, in the main, a lowered linear velocity of plasma and RBC flow through small parenchymal microvessels and not decreased percentage of perfused capillaries (capillary retirement). This response is probably driven mainly by lowered local metabolism and may well entail a slight increase in the number of small microvessels that are perfused by RBCs.},

Perfused capillaries were stained by labeling the plasma with the gamma globulin-coupled fluorochromes, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and lissamine-rhodamine B 200 (RB 200). The density of perfused capillaries was determined in 12 different brain structures by fluorescence microscopy of embedded brain sections following coronal sectioning in a cryostat. Significant differences were found among brain structures investigated; the lowest density of perfused capillaries was found in the white matter (e.g., corpus callosum 162 fragments/mm2), whereas the highest values were determined in the structures of the auditory system (e.g., inferior colliculus 810 fragments/mm2). LCBF and LCGU were measured in two separate groups of rats using standard autoradiographic methods. In all three experimental groups, the same structures were identified and measured with a high degree of accuracy and local resolution. Density of perfused capillaries correlated well with LCBF (r = 0.93) and even better with LCGU (r = 0.97). In addition to the relationship between LCGU and LCBF established by earlier studies, these data show the intimate interrelationship between LCGU, density of perfused capillaries, and LCBF.},

abstract = {Brain tissue movements were studied in axial, sagittal and coronal planes in 15 healthy volunteers, using a gated spin echo MRI sequence. All movements had characteristics different from those of perfusion and diffusion. The highest velocities occurred during systole in the basal ganglia (maximum 1.0 mm/s) and brain stem (maximum 1.5 mm/s). The movements were directed caudally, medially and posteriorly in the basal ganglia, and caudally-anteriorly in the pons. Caudad and anterior motion increased towards the foramen magnum and towards the midline. The resultant movement occurred in a funnel-shaped fashion as if the brain were pulled by the spinal cord. This may be explained by venting of brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through the tentorial notch and foramen magnum. The intracranial volume is assumed to be always constant by the Monro-Kellie doctrine. The intracranial dynamics can be viewed as an interplay between the spatial requirements of four main components: arterial blood, capillary blood (brain volume), venous blood and CSF. These components could be characterized, and the expansion of the arteries and the brain differentiated, by applying the Monro-Kellie doctrine to every moment of the cardiac cycle. The arterial expansion causes a re-moulding of the brain that enables its piston-like action. The arterial expansion creates the prerequisites for the expansion of the brain by venting CSF to the spinal canal. The expansion of the brain is, in turn, responsible for compression of the ventricular system and hence for the intraventricular flow of CSF.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent studies of the organization of the cerebral venous system in healthy subjects using phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) show its structural complexity and inter-individual variations. Our objective was to study the venous blood and CSF flows in cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMATERIALS AND METHODS: PC-MRI sequences were added to brain MRI conventional protocol in 19 patients suspected of CVT, among whom 6 patients had CVT diagnosis confirmed by MR venography. Results were compared with 18 healthy age-matched volunteers (HV).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In patients without CVT (NoCVT) confirmed by venography, we found heterogeneous individual venous flows, and variable side dominance in paired veins and sinuses, comparable to those in healthy volunteers. In CVT patients, PC-MRI detected no venous flow in the veins and/or sinuses with thrombosis. Arterial flows were preserved. CSF aqueductal and cervical stroke volumes were increased in a patient with secondary cerebral infarction, and decreased in 4 patients with extended thrombosis in the superior sagittal and transverse sinuses. These results suggest the main role of the venous system in the regulation of the dynamic intracranial equilibrium.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: CVT produces highly individualized pattern of disturbance in venous blood drainage. Complementary to MRI venography, PC-MRI provides non-invasive data about venous blockage consequences on CSF flow disturbances.},

abstract = {The brain tamponade represents the final condition of a progressive intracranial pressure (ICP) increase up to values close to arterial blood pressure (BP) producing a reverberating flow pattern in the cerebral arteries with no net flow. This finding implies intracranial volume changes, therefore a full application of the Monro-Kellie doctrine is impossible. To resolve this contradiction, in eight pigs a reversible condition of brain tamponade was produced by infusing saline into a cerebral ventricle. The following parameters were measured: BP in the common carotid artery, ICP by the same needle utilised for the infusion, arterial and venous blood flow velocity (BFV) at, respectively, internal carotid artery (ICA) and sagittal sinus (SS) site by ultrasound technique. When ICP approached carotid BP values, reverberating BFV waves both at ICA and SS site were simultaneously observed. The arterial and venous reverberating waves appeared to be almost exactly superimposable, with a delay of about 40 msec. This synchronism between the pulsatile arterial and venous BFV indicates that the residual pulsation, still occurring at the arterial proximal level, is compensated by a passive compression-distension of the SS with no blood volume (that is net flow) crossing the intracranial vasculature.},

Stable increases in venous pressure consistently induced arteriolar vasodilation, which averaged 6-12\% of the control diameter. The vasodilation occurred when arterial blood pressure was normal and during arterial hypotension induced by bleeding; it also occurred irrespective of whether intracranial pressure was kept constant or was allowed to increase venous hypertension. The results are consistent with the view that autoregulatory adjustments in caliber of pial arterioles are mediated predominantly by metabolic rather than myogenic mechanisms.},

Dynamic-susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI, also known as bolus-tracking MRI, is a dynamic MRI method to measure perfusion and other related hemodynamic parameters. This review article describes the principles involved in perfusion quantification using DSC-MRI as well as discusses the main issues affecting its quantification in patient studies. CONCLUSIONS: It is shown that DSC-MRI is a very powerful technique that provides important information regarding cerebral hemodynamics. The relatively high contrast-to-noise ratio, fast acquisition, and wealth of information available have made DSC-MRI the most commonly used MRI technique for the rapid assessment of the brain hemodynamics in clinical investigations. While very important advances have been achieved in the last 2 decades, there are still some remaining limitations that users should be aware of to avoid misinterpretation of the findings and to make the most of the invaluable information provided by perfusion MRI.},

abstract = {Arterial spin labeling (ASL) can be used to measure perfusion without the use of contrast agents. Due to the small volume fraction of blood vessels compared to tissue in the human brain (typ. 3-5\%) ASL techniques have an intrinsically low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this publication, evidence is presented that the SNR can be improved by using arterial spin labeling in combination with single-shot 3D readout techniques. Specifically, a single-shot 3D-GRASE sequence is presented, which yields a 2.8-fold increase in SNR compared to 2D EPI at the same nominal resolution. Up to 18 slices can be acquired in 2 min with an SNR of 10 or more for gray matter perfusion. A method is proposed to increase the reliability of perfusion quantification using QUIPSS II derivates by acquiring low-resolution maps of the bolus arrival time, which allows differentiation between lack of perfusion and delayed arrival of the labeled blood. For arterial spin labeling, single-shot 3D imaging techniques are optimal in terms of efficiency and might prove beneficial to improve reliability of perfusion quantitation in a clinical setup.},

@article{Wu2007,
abstract = {Arterial spin labeling (ASL) is capable of noninvasively measuring blood flow by magnetically tagging the protons in arterial blood, which has been conventionally achieved using instantaneous (PASL) or continuous (CASL) RF pulses. As an intermediate method, pseudocontinuous ASL (pCASL) utilizes a train of discrete RF pulses to mimic continuous tagging that is often unavailable on imagers due to the requirement of continuous RF transmit capabilities. In the present study, we implemented two versions of pCASL (balanced and unbalanced gradient waveforms in tag and control scans) for both transmit/receive coils and array receivers. Experimental data show a 50\% +/- 4\% increase of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared with PASL and a higher tagging efficiency than amplitude-modulated (AM) CASL (80\% vs. 68\%). Computer simulations predict an optimal tagging efficiency of 85\% for flow velocities from 10 to 60 cm/s. It is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that the tagging efficiency of pCASL is dependent upon the resonance offset and flip angle of the RF pulse train. We conclude that pCASL has the potential of combining the merits of PASL, including less hardware demand and higher tagging efficiency, and CASL, which includes a longer tagging bolus and thus higher SNR. These improvements provide a better balance between tagging efficiency and SNR.},

Equations able to mimic the behavior of the intracranial arterial vascular bed, intracranial venous vascular bed, cerebrospinal fluid absorption and production pro- cesses, and the constancy of overall intracranial volume are separately presented and discussed. The model parameters were given normal values computed using physio- logical considerations and recent anatomical data. In this paper the model is used to simulate the genesis and morphology of the intracranial pressure pulse wave. In par- ticular, dependence of the intracranial pressure pulse amplitude on mean intracranial pressure, obtained from the model, shows excellent agreement with recent experimen- tal findings. The model explains the intracranial pressure pulse wave as the result of the pulsating changes in cerebral blood volume (related to cerebrovascular compli- ance) which occur within a rigid space (i.e., the craniospinal compartmenO. At low and medium values of intracranial pressure, the intracranial pressure pulse amplitude mainly reflects the cerebral pressure-volume relationship. However, during severe intracranial hypertension, an abrupt increase in the cerebrovascular compliance becomes evident, which is reflected in an abrupt increase in the intracranial pressure pulse wave.},

abstract = {The relationship between intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebrospinal fluid dynamics, and the action of cerebral blood-flow (CBF) regulatory mechanisms is examined in this work with the help of an original mathematical model. In building the model, particular emphasis is placed on reproducing the mechanical properties of proximal cerebral arteries and small pial arterioles, and their active regulatory response to perfusion pressure and cerebral blood flow changes. The model allows experimental results on cerebral vessel dilatation and cerebral blood-flow regulation, following cerebral perfusion pressure decrease, to be satisfactorily reproduced. Moreover, the effect of cerebral blood volume changes--induced by autoregulatory adjustments--on the intracranial pressure time pattern can be examined at different levels of arterial hypotension. The results obtained with normal parameter values demonstrate that, at the lower limits of autoregulation, when dilatation of small arterioles becomes maximal, the increase in cerebral blood volume can cause a significant, transient increase in intracranial pressure. This antagonism between intracranial pressure and autoregulatory adjustments can lead to instability of the intracranial system in pathological conditions. In particular, analysis of the linearized system "in the small" demonstrates that an impairment in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reabsorption, a decrease in intracranial compliance and a high-regulatory capacity of the cerebrovascular bed are all conditions which can lead the system equilibrium to become unstable (i.e., the real part of at least one eigenvalue to turn out positive). Accordingly, mathematical simulation "in the large," in the above-mentioned conditions, exhibits intracranial pressure periodic fluctuations which closely resemble, in amplitude, duration, frequency and shape, the well-known Lundberg A-waves (or plateau waves).},

abstract = {A simple mathematical model of intracranial pressure (ICP) dynamics oriented to clinical practice is presented. It includes the hemodynamics of the arterial-arteriolar cerebrovascular bed, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production and reabsorption processes, the nonlinear pressure-volume relationship of the craniospinal compartment, and a Starling resistor mechanism for the cerebral veins. Moreover, arterioles are controlled by cerebral autoregulation mechanisms, which are simulated by means of a time constant and a sigmoidal static characteristic. The model is used to simulate interactions between ICP, cerebral blood volume, and autoregulation. Three different related phenomena are analyzed: the generation of plateau waves, the effect of acute arterial hypotension on ICP, and the role of cerebral hemodynamics during pressure-volume index (PVI) tests. Simulation results suggest the following: 1) ICP dynamics may become unstable in patients with elevated CSF outflow resistance and decreased intracranial compliance, provided cerebral autoregulation is efficient. Instability manifests itself with the occurrence of self-sustained plateau waves. 2) Moderate acute arterial hypotension may have completely different effects on ICP, depending on the value of model parameters. If physiological compensatory mechanisms (CSF circulation and intracranial storage capacity) are efficient, acute hypotension has only negligible effects on ICP and cerebral blood flow (CBF). If these compensatory mechanisms are poor, even modest hypotension may induce a large transient increase in ICP and a significant transient reduction in CBF, with risks of secondary brain damage. 3) The ICP response to a bolus injection (PVI test) is sharply affected, via cerebral blood volume changes, by cerebral hemodynamics and autoregulation. We suggest that PVI tests may be used to extract information not only on intracranial compliance and CSF circulation, but also on the status of mechanisms controlling CBF.},

In recent years computational models, and it must be noted computer architecture have evolved to an extent where mathematicians and engineers can play a large part in discovering how the brain functions physiologically as well as investigating pathological conditions. This review will look at a number of increasingly complex computational models of blood flow to the brain and how variations in arterial geometry can influence the perfusion in the cerebral vasculature.

Physical models required for CFD simulation were introduced including a model for arterial wall motion due to fluid-wall interactions, a shear thinning fluid model of blood, a vascular bed model for outflow boundary conditions, and a model for autoregulation mechanism. The three-dimensional unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations coupled with these models were solved iteratively using the pseudocompressibility method and dual time stepping. Gravity source terms were added to the Navier-Stokes equations to take the effect of gravity into account. For the treatment of complex geometry, a chimera overset grid technique was adopted to obtain connectivity between arterial branches. For code validation, computed results were compared with experimental data for both steady-state and time-dependent flows. This computational approach was then applied to blood flows through a realistic carotid bifurcation and two Circle of Willis models, one using an idealized geometry and the other using an anatomical data set. A three-dimensional Circle of Willis configuration was reconstructed from subject-specific magnetic resonance images using an image segmentation method. Through the numerical simulation of blood flow in two model problems, namely, the carotid bifurcation and the brain arteries, it was observed that the altered gravity has considerable effects on arterial contraction/dilatation and consequent changes in flow conditions.},

Considerable controversy exists about fluid and pressure dynamics, and about how the brain responds to changes in flow patterns and compression in hydrocephalus. This paper presents a new model based on the first principles of fluid mechanics. This model of fluid-structure interactions predicts flows and pressures throughout the brain's ventricular pathways consistent with both animal intracranial pressure (ICP) measurements and human CINE phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging data. The computations provide approximations of the tissue deformations of the brain parenchyma. The model also quantifies the pulsatile CSF motion including flow reversal in the aqueduct as well as the changes in ICPs due to brain tissue compression. It does not require the existence of large transmural pressure differences as the force for ventricular expansion.

abstract = {Advances in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques enable the accurate measurements of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow in the human brain. In addition, image reconstruction tools facilitate the collection of patient-specific brain geometry data such as the exact dimensions of the ventricular and subarachnoidal spaces (SAS) as well as the computer-aided reconstruction of the CSF-filled spaces. The solution of the conservation of CSF mass and momentum balances over a finite computational mesh obtained from the MR images predict the patients' CSF flow and pressure field. Advanced image reconstruction tools used in conjunction with first principles of fluid mechanics allow an accurate verification of the CSF flow patters for individual patients. This paper presents a detailed analysis of pulsatile CSF flow and pressure dynamics in a normal and hydrocephalic patient. Experimental CSF flow measurements and computational results of flow and pressure fields in the ventricular system, the SAS and brain parenchyma are presented. The pulsating CSF motion is explored in normal and pathological conditions of communicating hydrocephalus. This paper predicts small transmantle pressure differences between lateral ventricles and SASs (approximately 10 Pa). The transmantle pressure between ventricles and SAS remains small even in the hydrocephalic patient (approximately 30 Pa), but the ICP pulsatility increases by a factor of four. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) results of the predicted CSF flow velocities are in good agreement with Cine MRI measurements. Differences between the predicted and observed CSF flow velocities in the prepontine area point towards complex brain-CSF interactions. The paper presents the complete computational model to predict the pulsatile CSF flow in the cranial cavity.},

abstract = {Raised intracranial pressure (ICP) and low cerebral blood flow (CBF) are associated with ischaemia and poor outcome after brain injury. Therefore, many management protocols target these parameters. This overview summarizes the technical aspects of ICP and CBF monitoring, and their role in the clinical management of brain-injured patients. Furthermore, some applications of these methods in current research are highlighted. ICP is typically measured using probes that are inserted into one of the lateral ventricles or the brain parenchyma. Therapeutic measures used to control ICP have relevant side-effects and continuous monitoring is essential to guide such therapies. ICP is also required to calculate cerebral perfusion pressure which is one of the most important therapeutic targets in brain-injured patients. Several bedside CBF monitoring devices are available. However, most do not measure CBF but rather a parameter that is thought to be proportional to CBF. Frequently used methods include transcranial Doppler which measures blood flow velocity and may be helpful for the diagnosis and monitoring of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid haemorrhage or jugular bulb oximetry which gives information on adequacy of CBF in relation to the metabolic demand of the brain. However, there is no clear evidence that incorporating data from CBF monitors into our management strategies improves outcome in brain-injured patients.},

abstract = {The majority of contemporary hydrocephalus valves are designed to introduce a low resistance to flow into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage pathway, and an therefore intended to stabilise intracranial pressure (ICP) at a level close to the shunt's operating pressure. However, this goal cannot always be attained. Accelerated CSF drainage with vertical body posture in ventriculo-peritoneal shunts is one reason for the ICP decreasing below the shunt's operating pressure. Another possible factor has been studied: the impact of the pulsating pattern in the ICP on the operating pressure. Six popular constructions of medium-pressure valves were studied (Radionics Low-profile, Delta, Hakim Precision, Holter, Integra In-line and Hakim NMT). Valves were mounted in the testing rig in the UK. Shunt Evaluation Laboratory and perfused with de-ionised water at a rate of 0.3 ml min(-1), and proximal pulsating pressures of different amplitudes (from 2 to 30mmHg peak-to-peak) and frequencies (70-10 cycles min(-1)) were superimposed. Laboratory findings were compared with clinical material containing recordings of ICP made in patients to diagnose reasons for ventriculomegaly. The mean operating pressure decreased in all valves when the simulated amplitude of heart pulsations increased. The rate of this decrease was dependent on the type of valve (variable from 2.5 to 5 mm Hg per increase in peak-to-peak amplitude by 10 mm Hg). The decrease was not related to the frequency of the wave. The relationship between pulse amplitude and ICP in 35 patients with blocked shunts was strong (R = 0.48; p < 0.03; slope 0.14) and in 25 patients with properly functioning shunts was non-significant (R = 0.057; p = 0.765). Two examples of decrease in mean ICP in the presence of increased vasogenic ICP waves in shunted patients are presented. The shunt operating pressure, which 'sets' the ICP in shunted patients may be influenced by the dynamics of a patient's ICP waveform.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We have previously reported a model of cerebral hydrodynamics in the form of an equivalent electrical circuit. The aim of this work was to demonstrate that the model could predict venous flow patterns seen in the superior sagittal sinus (SSS), straight sinus (STS), and jugular vein (JV) in normal volunteers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electrical equivalence model of CSF and cerebral blood flow was fitted to measured arterial and CSF data from 16 healthy volunteers. Predictions of the venous outflow waveform derived from the model were compared with measured venous flows in the SSS, STS, and JV. RESULTS: The model accurately predicted the measured jugular waveform. The measured waveforms from SSS and STS showed a less pronounced and delayed systolic peak compared with the predicted outflow. The fitted bulk model parameters provided relative values that correspond approximately to the impedance of arterial capillaries (1.0), cerebral aqueduct ( approximately 0), venous capillaries ( approximately 0), and arteries (0.01) and for the elastic capacitance of the ventricles (4.11), capillaries ( approximately 0), and veins (271). The elastic capacitance of the major cerebral arteries was large and could not be accurately determined. CONCLUSIONS: We have confirmed the ability of the model to predict the venous waveforms in healthy persons. The absence of any statistically significant component of the venous waveform not described by the model implies that measurements of venous flow could be used to constrain further the model-fitting process.},

abstract = {The microvascular relationships important to surgery of aneurysms in the anterior communicating region were defined in 50 cadaver brains. The recurrent artery of Heubner was frequently exposed before the A-1 segment in defining the neck on anterior cerebral aneurysms because it commonly courses anterior to A-1. It arose from the A-2 segment of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) in 78\% and most commonly terminated in the area of the anterior perforated substance, and lateral to it in the Sylvian fissure. The anterior communicating artery (ACoA) frequently gave rise to perforating arteries which terminated in the superior surface of the optic chiasm and above the chiasm in the anterior hypothalamus. This finding contrasts with previous reports that no perforating branches arise from the communicating artery. The proximal half of the A=1 segment was a richer source of perforating arteries than the distal half. The A-1 branches most commonly terminated in the anterior perforated substance, the optic chiasm, and the region of the optic tract. The ACoA increased in size as the difference in the diameter between the right and left A-1 segments increased. Frequent variants such as double or triple ACoA's, triple A-2 segments, and duplication of the A-1 segments were encountered. The clinical consequences of occlusion of the recurrent artery and of the perforators from the ACoA and medial and lateral segment of A-1 are reviewed.},

@article{Hillen1986,
abstract = {The results are presented of a statistical analysis of the variability of the circle of Willis using univariate and bivariate methods. For this purpose 100 circles of Willis were available. From each circle 19 indexes of arterial size were determined, the basilar artery was measured in two places. Half the circumference was measured. This data yielded no evidence of differences between left- and right-sided vessels in the sample. An important source of variation is the general size of all vessels considered. When the data are cleared from this general size variation, correlation coefficients reveal interesting relations between the vessels. The posterior communicating arteries are strongly related to the ipsilateral carotid artery, whereas a strong inverse relationship exists with the basilar artery and the precommunicating part of the ipsilateral posterior cerebral artery. These relationships can be understood from the expected patterns of the blood flow in these vessels. Similar relationships can be found in the anterior part of the circle of Willis and in the vertebro-basilar junction. In a different manner, based on previous haemodynamic studies, the relation between blood flow and vessel size within the circle of Willis can be demonstrated by relating the ratios of the sizes of afferent and efferent arteries to the sizes of the posterior communicating arteries, an "intuitive" model. The supposed correlations of the outcome of this "intuitive" model with the size of the communicating arteries appeared to by highly significant. It is concluded that the variations of the circle of Willis are related to the individual variations of the blood flow in this arterial network.},

@article{Cassot1995,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Collateral circulatory pathways are considered the primary determinant of cerebral hemodynamics in patients with obstructive lesions of the internal carotid arteries (ICaAs). However, the hemodynamic effects of the diameter of the anterior communicating artery (ACoA) have never been assessed quantitatively in humans. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two different mathematical models were used to simulate changes affecting blood pressures and flows in cerebral arteries as a function of ACoA diameter and ICaA stenoses or occlusions. Small changes in ACoA diameter were found to have marked hemodynamic effects when they occurred within the range of 0.4 to 1.6 mm, a situation observed in 80\% of the cases. Outside this range, changes in ACoA diameter had no effect. Simulated pressure drops through a stenotic ICaA were consistent with those observed. They were found to depend on the degrees of the stenoses in both ICaAs and on ACoA diameter according to a simple equation. Pressure reserve in the middle and anterior cerebral arteries decreased to below the lower limit of autoregulation, despite a normal mean arterial blood pressure, when the arteries were distal to a unique 70\% ICaA stenosis associated with a small-diameter ACoA or to a 50\% ICaA stenosis associated with a contralateral ICaA occlusion and a large-diameter ACoA. Above these thresholds, the circle of Willis allowed for an almost complete global cerebral blood flow compensation that involved all the afferent and communicating vessels. CONCLUSIONS: ACoA diameter strongly modulates the effects of ICaA lesions on cerebral hemodynamics. Some proposals for endarterectomy indications can be derived from our study.},

abstract = {Measurement of tissue perfusion is important for the functional assessment of organs in vivo. Here we report the use of 1H NMR imaging to generate perfusion maps in the rat brain at 4.7 T. Blood water flowing to the brain is saturated in the neck region with a slice-selective saturation imaging sequence, creating an endogenous tracer in the form of proximally saturated spins. Because proton T1 times are relatively long, particularly at high field strengths, saturated spins exchange with bulk water in the brain and a steady state is created where the regional concentration of saturated spins is determined by the regional blood flow and regional T1. Distal saturation applied equidistantly outside the brain serves as a control for effects of the saturation pulses. Average cerebral blood flow in normocapnic rat brain under halothane anesthesia was determined to be 105 +/- 16 cc.100 g-1.min-1 (mean +/- SEM, n = 3), in good agreement with values reported in the literature, and was sensitive to increases in arterial pCO2. This technique allows regional perfusion maps to be measured noninvasively, with the resolution of 1H MRI, and should be readily applicable to human studies.},

abstract = {A technique has been developed for proton magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of perfusion, using water as a freely diffusable tracer, and its application to the measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the rat is demonstrated. The method involves labeling the inflowing water proton spins in the arterial blood by inverting them continuously at the neck region and observing the effects of inversion on the intensity of brain MRI. Solution to the Bloch equations, modified to include the effects of flow, allows regional perfusion rates to be measured from an image with spin inversion, a control image, and a T1 image. Continuous spin inversion labeling the arterial blood water was accomplished, using principles of adiabatic fast passage by applying continuous-wave radio-frequency power in the presence of a magnetic field gradient in the direction of arterial flow. In the detection slice used to measure perfusion, whole brain CBF averaged 1.39 +/- 0.19 ml.g-1. min-1 (mean +/- SEM, n = 5). The technique's sensitivity to changes in CBF was measured by using graded hypercarbia, a condition that is known to increase brain perfusion. CBF vs. pCO2 data yield a best-fit straight line described by CBF (ml.g-1.min-1) = 0.052pCO2 (mm Hg) - 0.173, in excellent agreement with values in the literature. Finally, perfusion images of a freeze-injured rat brain have been obtained, demonstrating the technique's ability to detect regional abnormalities in perfusion.},

In vivo PCASL labeling efficiency of 96\% relative to continuous labeling with comparable labeling parameters far exceeded the 33\% duty cycle of the PCASL RF pulses.
